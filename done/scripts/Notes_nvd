1. Adding a new base sequence. 
-------------------------------

Currently there is option for adding a sequence where new file is created and new sequence 
is written it. The new sequence is extended from base sequence already existing in testbench.

In some cases two (or more) base sequences are needed.
There should be option of addng a new base sequence and further sequences can be added by
extending that new+ base sequence.

The new added base sequence should be instantiated in the v_sequence (in which the previous base sequence
is already there).
